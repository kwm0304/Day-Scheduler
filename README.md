This Work-Day-Scheduler application displays the date and time at the top of the page and lets the user enter tasks for a given time throughout the work day.

Tasks can be saved by clicking on the disk icon on the right side of the column so even if the page closes or refreshes, the task will remain displayed. Confirmation of the task being saved is given by a thumbs up icon appearing beside the disk.
